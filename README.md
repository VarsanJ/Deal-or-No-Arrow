# Deal Or No Arrow
Welcome to Deal or No Arrow, a spinoff game of Deal or No Deal with more movements and an enhanced gameplay environment. This game enables you to test your luck and your reasoning skills as you aim to make the most points. Aim to earn as many points as you can, but do not get too greedy. Compete to become some of the highest ranked players in the game. 

# Objective and Information
This game is a modified version of “Deal or No Deal”, with a different format to select boxes. There are some briefcases stacked along the opposite edge along with a cannon facing horizontally. Based on the power applied by the user, briefcases are selected by where the cannonball lands (which box it touches). Each round, calculations determine an offer for the user, in terms of points, which the user can accept or reject. In the end, they can choose to accept the final offer or open their briefcase. The total number of points is saved in a text file used for rankings.
